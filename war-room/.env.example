# AI Model Configuration
# Choose your preferred AI provider by setting ONE of the following API keys:

# Option 1: Google Vertex AI (Recommended for tool calling with Gemini)
# Get your credentials from: https://console.cloud.google.com/
# You need to set up a Google Cloud project and enable Vertex AI API
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your_google_project_id
GOOGLE_LOCATION=us-central1
# For authentication, either set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS or use gcloud auth
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account-key.json

# Option 2: Hugging Face (Fallback option, limited tool support)
# Get your API key from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key_here

# Note: The chat functionality will work with mock responses if no API key is provided
# If Vertex AI is configured, it will be prioritized for better tool calling support with Gemini models
