## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Setup (Optional - for Hugging Face Integration)

The chat feature works with intelligent mock responses out of the box. To enable real AI responses using Hugging Face:

1. Get a free Hugging Face API key:
   - Visit [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
   - Create a new access token (read access is sufficient)

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

3. Add your API key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

4. Restart the development server

**Note**: The app will automatically fall back to smart mock responses if no API key is provided, so this step is completely optional!

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
